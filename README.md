# Stemcheck

# Objective:
The objective is to enhance the efficiency of the assignment feedback process by implementing a GUI system that automates feedback mechanisms, reduces feedback time significantly, and provides a foundation for potential AI/ML model training and future automation, thereby improving workflow productivity and user experience.

# Scope
The GUI facilitates real-time monitoring of assignment processing, empowering workflow adjustments for optimal efficiency. It drastically reduces assignment feedback time from 10 minutes to 1 minute, enhancing user experience and productivity. It serves as a vital data source for AI/ML model training, setting the stage for future feedback system automation and efficiency improvements.

# Repository Structure
scripts: Includes the Python script for automating the feedback mechanism and generating data for further AI/ML models. Also includes the GUI bat.

data_files: Placeholder for any data files required by the application.

graphics: Images and logo files related to the project.

# Prerequisites:
Python installed (version 3.6 or higher).

Required Python libraries installed (pandas, streamlit, pyperclip, os, etc.).

Internet access for external resources.

# Instructions:
Running the Streamlit Career Exploration App:

Method 1: Using GUI.bat File Locate the GUI.bat file in the scripts/ directory. Double-click on GUI.bat to launch the application. Alternatively, create a shortcut for GUI.bat on your desktop for convenient access.

Method 2: Using Streamlit Script Open a command prompt or terminal. Navigate to the scripts/ directory using cd path/to/your/application. Run the command: streamlit run Home.py. Access the GUI at the provided URL (usually http://localhost:8501). Enter your details, select the assignment file to be reviewed, choose email-id and feedbacks for that email-id.

# Developer Instructions:
Running the Streamlit STEM-Assignment-Checker-App:
Importing Libraries: Open a Python environment or code editor. Import necessary libraries using the provided script.

Creating the Streamlit Interface: Define the Streamlit interface within the main() function. Implement user inputs and error handling as specified in the script.

Running the Application: Follow Method 1 or Method 2 as mentioned in Instructions.

# Conclusion:
By following this comprehensive readme, users can effectively run the STEM-Assignment-Checker-GUI application, automate the feedback process, generate excel sheet, and developers can maintain and update the application.
