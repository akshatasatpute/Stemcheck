In 3rd milestone you should write what you will do and “how” will you do it?? Milestone 1 is what you want to achieve in age 21-22yrs, Milestone 2 is what you want to achieve in 24-25yrs, so think in this pattern for the 3rd milestone too. The milestones should be specific.

Skills – For skills, in pages 38 &42 you must write the hard skills(technical), you have already learnt in your college - talk to your teachers; and page 39 &43 you must write the technical skills, you want to learn later, to get a job, for this look at the Kalpana career exploration handbook provided by VigyanShaala. Additionally, the hard skills must be relevant to your goal!

Career Options - The career options are job titles/names of job roles you want to apply to, for your goal. Key employers, are the names of companies where you can get these jobs.
